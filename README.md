This is the final assignment of the freshman C++ programming course. Now it is made public for reference by younger students.

For privacy reasons, my real name and student ID have been deliberately changed. This project is only for public reference. Please do not use it for illegal purposes. I do not bear any legal responsibility.

All design architectures and usage methods are summarized in the assignment paper, and all program code parts are in the ATMsystem folder (including .csv data files).
